    lwip_echo_server:
      description: The lwIP Echo Server application provides a simple demonstration of how to use the light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use IP address 192.168.1.10 or IPv6 FE80:0:0:0:20A:35FF:FE00:102, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. The server listens for input at port 7 and simply echoes back whatever data is sent to that port.

    lwip_tcp_perf_client:
      description: The LwIP TCP Perf Client application is used for creating TCP client and measure TCP uplink performance using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10 and IPv6 link local address whenipv6_enable is true, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. This application creates TCP client on board and make connection with TCP server running on host machine. It will display connection information along with interim and average TCP statistics for data transfer.

      description: The LwIP TCP Server application is used for creating TCP server using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10 and IPv6 link local address when ipv6_enable is true, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. The application creates TCP server on board and starts listening for TCP client connections. It will display client connection info and also display interim and average TCP statistics for data transfer. This application handles only 1 client connection at a time.

    lwip_udp_perf_client:
      description: The LwIP UDP Perf Client application is used for creating UDP client and measure UDP uplink performance using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. This application creates UDP client on board and make connection with UDP server running on host machine. It will display connection information along with interim and average UDP statistics for data transfer.

    lwip_udp_perf_server:
      description: The LwIP UDP Perf Server application is used for creating UDP server and measure downlink performance using light-weight IP stack (lwIP). This application sets up the board to use default IP address 192.168.1.10, with MAC address 00:0a:35:00:01:02. The application creates UDP server on board and starts listening for UDP client connections. It will display client connection information with interim and average UDP statistics for data transfer.
